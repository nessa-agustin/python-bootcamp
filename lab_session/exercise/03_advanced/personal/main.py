"""
Simple Shopping List App (Flask Session Edition)

This exercise guides you through creating a basic shopping list web app using Flask.
Users will be able to:
- View their shopping list
- Add items to the list

You will store the data inside the Flask session so it persists during the user's session.
No database required.

Don't use global variables.
Do everything using session, form handling, and template rendering.
